        or the goal of the study. The goal of a study might be to identify or describe
        a concept or to explain or predict a situation or solution to a situation that
        indicates the type of study to be conducted.

        Every study has an explicit or implicit purpose statement.
        \n\n

        supports the problem and clarifies the knowledge to be generated for nursing.
